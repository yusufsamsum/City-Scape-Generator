# City Scape Generator
This program use WebGL functions to generate a static picture like at the below. The user can specify the number of houses and maximum number of storey for houses. The program generates an image with respect to these inputs. The number of storey select randomly for each house but it cannot be higher than the limit which specified by the user. Also, storey's and roof's colors are chosen randomly by the program. This program can be runned by a simple browser(i.e. Google Chrome) with dragging cityScape.html file on the browser. However, the program will use the sources, so file order should not be changed.
